                    <p><center><b>Joe Puccio</b></center></p>
                    <p>I have the best words. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. They’re typists … And some, I assume, are good words. And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. Are they small words? Greater than ever before. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. You’re disgusting.</p>

                    <p>An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. He’s a word hero because he was captured. Look at that text! Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text ... The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different?</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p><center><b>Ethan Frank</b></center></p>
                    <p>All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. It's an art you're basically born with. It's not nice." Look at these words. They made a good decision. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists … And some, I assume, are good words. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. We are going to make placeholder text great again. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.
